Angular is a framework for building modern **single-page
applications**.

## Single-Page vs Traditional Application

### Traditional Applications

Every single user action results in a full HTML page load.

### Single-Page Applications

- A single-page web application is composed, naturally, of
a single page that is updated based on user actions.

- Single-page applications usually perform a 
**partial update**, instead of a full page reload.

- The single-page app can communicate with the server using
a REST API for data exchange.

### Examples of Single-Page web apps:

1. Google Maps
2. Gmail (most email web applications)

## Angular Solutions

Could I not just do everything myself with **JavaScript, jQuery,
AJAX**, etc.?  
It may work for small basic hobby apps, but for common features
such as **data binding**, you may reinvent the wheel.  
Plus, it would be hard to manage and mantain for **enterprise
real-time applications**.

This is actually the main reason why we have frameworks such
as **Angular, React.js, Vue.js, ...**
